# Helldivers 2 Stratagem Randomizer

You can access the Randomizer [here](https://xoneris.github.io/Helldivers2-randomizer/).

A small webapp created with [React](https://react.dev) that gives you a random loadout of stratagems and weapons for the videogame [Helldivers 2](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/). 

## Current Features

- You can randomize your stratagems and weapons.
- You can click on stratagems to deselect them from the randomizing procces. In case you don't have unlocked or don't want certain strategems in your loadout. 
- You can toggle an option that your results will only include either one backpack and/or one support weapon.
- If you don't own the Super Citizen DLC you can toggle an option so the one weapon that comes with that DLC can not show up in the result.
- You can toggle any or all premium warbonds, which will prevent the content of a specific warbond to appear in the result.
 - Currently there is no option to select individual weapons from a warbond to appear or not appear in the result.
