You can access the Randomizer [here](https://xoneris.github.io/Helldivers2-randomizer/).

## Current Features

- You can click on Strategems to deselect them from the randomizing procces. In case you don't have unlocked or don't want certain strategems in your loadout. 
- The randomizer can give you either 3 or 4 strategems depending how many you can use on your planet.
- You can toggle an option that your random results will only include either one and/or one support weapon.
  - Known bug: in 1% of cases or so the randomizer will still give you 2 backpack or support weapons.
